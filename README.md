# G00373984:
# Description
This is a program Written in Python 3 that takes a regular expression and a file as command line arguments and outputs the number of matches for the regular expression within the file. You may limit yourself to regular languages, with the concatenation operator ., the or operator |, and the Kleene star *.

To run the application:
Have python installed and set up on the machine.
Clone the repo to your machine - git clone (    ).
cd into (    ).
Have a script editor such as Visual Studio/Vs code.

Explain the difference between regular expressions in infix notation and those in postfix notation.
Explain how Thompson's construction for regular expressions works.
Explain what is meant by the term irregular language in the context of regular expressions.

1: firstly we can start with identifying what a regular expression is. Regular expressions came about in 1951 from a mathematician known as Stephen Cole Kleene.
   He described regular languages using his mathematical notation called regular events. A regular expression also known as regex, is a string of text that allows you to create      patterns that help match, locate, and manage text. These strings are compared to this pattern to see if they fit the pattern defined by the expression. Regex is a combination      of two types of characters, literals and special characters. Regular expressions are used in search engines, search and replace dialog boxes of word processors and text            editors, examples of this can be seen in Visual studio code in the search function whereby the user can enter in a regular expression into the search box, they can choose to      just find or find and replace a certain item using a regular expression. examples of special characters '' , '^', '$' , '.' , '|' , '?' , '*' , '+' , '(' , ')' '{' '[]'
   Difference between regular expressions in Infix and PostFix Notation.
   Regular expressions in Infix Notation occur where the operators are written in between their operands.  
   Regular expressions in Postfix Notation occur where the operators are used after their operands.
